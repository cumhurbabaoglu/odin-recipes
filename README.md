This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It demonstrates basic HTML and CSS skills without JavaScript implementation.

## Features
- HTML boilerplate
- Internal navigation between pages
- Recipe images
- Ordered and unordered lists
- CSS

## Future Improvements
