    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep all of the veggies.</li>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat, add the onion and garlic, and stir for 3-4 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Then lower to medium heat, add carrots, celery, salt, and pepper, and saute for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, salt and spices and saute for 2-3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour in the lentils, broth and water. Increase to medium-high heat, bring to a boil, cover, and lower heat to a gentle simmer for 20 minutes or until lentils are cooked through.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Using an immersion blender, puree the soup- leaving a little texture. (Or blend half of the soup in the blender or food processor.) *If you prefer a thinner soup, add more broth or liquid to desired consistency, seasoning as necessary. </li>
        <li>Squeeze with ½ of the lemon and a generous pinch of cayenne. Taste, adjusting salt, lemon juice and cayenne to taste.  The soup will start to taste more flavorful as it cools down a bit. If it tastes bland, it just needs salt. Just make sure salt and lemon are adequate and balanced. This is key.</li>
