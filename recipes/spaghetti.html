    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Crispy caramelised pieces of tomato packed pasta are what makes this Italian dish unique. This classic pasta dish is from the Puglia region of Italy and often called assassin’s spaghetti (spaghetti all’Assassina, in Italian) or killer spaghetti. This pasta can be controversial as it is a pasta dish that you literally burn to add the depth of flavour and to cook the pasta at the same time.
</p>
        <p>Assassin spaghetti sauce is often a rich tomato-based sauce with a hint of chilli. We have made our sauce a milder version but, if you like it more fiery, increase the heat to your liking. This pasta dish uses a similar technique to the making of risotto, adding ladlefuls of the tomato broth to the pasta and letting it absorb before adding more.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>90g (1/3 cup) tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>500g btl Coles Mum's Sause Tomato & Basil</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp dried chilli flakes</li>
            <li>250g spaghettini</li>
            <li>Finely grated parmesan, to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the tomato paste and 750ml (3 cups) water in a large saucepan. Season with salt and bring just to the boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to very low to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a very large frying pan over high heat. Add the sause and chilli flakes. Bring to the boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes or until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Lay the pasta in the tomato sauce mixture over the base of the pan (do not stir). Spoon the tomato sauce mixture around the pasta, and over the top, to cover. Cook, without stirring, for 2-3 minutes or until the pasta starts to caramelise underneath and char slightly.</li>
            <li>Ladle about 125ml (1/2 cup) of the simmering tomato stock over the pasta. Use tongs to turn the pasta over. Cook, without stirring, for 1-2 minutes or until the liquid is completely absorbed and the pasta continues to caramelise underneath. Repeat, adding the remaining tomato stock, a ladleful at a time, and cooking for 1-2 minutes before adding the next ladleful, allowing the pasta to continue to caramelise between batches, or until al dente. This will take 15-17 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide pasta mixture among serving bowls and top with parmesan, to serve. Watch our step-by-step video below to see how to make our One-pan caramelised tomato spaghetti recipe.</li>
