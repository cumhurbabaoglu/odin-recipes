        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Crispy caramelised pieces of tomato packed pasta are what makes this Italian dish unique. This classic pasta dish is from the Puglia region of Italy and often called assassin’s spaghetti (spaghetti all’Assassina, in Italian) or killer spaghetti. This pasta can be controversial as it is a pasta dish that you literally burn to add the depth of flavour and to cook the pasta at the same time.</p>
            <p>Assassin spaghetti sauce is often a rich tomato-based sauce with a hint of chilli. We have made our sauce a milder version but, if you like it more fiery, increase the heat to your liking. This pasta dish uses a similar technique to the making of risotto, adding ladlefuls of the tomato broth to the pasta and letting it absorb before adding more. </p>
